# A*-algorithm
A * algorithm is a searching algorithm that searches for the shortest path between the initial and the final state. It is used in various applications, such as maps. In maps the A* algorithm is used to calculate the shortest distance between the source (initial state) and the destination (final state).
Like Dijkstra, A* works by making a lowest-cost path tree from the start node to the target node. What makes A* different and better for many searches is that for each node, A* uses a function f ( n ) f(n) f(n) that gives an estimate of the total cost of a path using that node.
Even though Dijkstra's algorithm and the A* algorithm both find the same shortest paths, the A* algorithm does it almost 60 times faster.
